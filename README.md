# odin-Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is my code for the Rock Paper Scissors project in The Odin Project Foundations course where I am using JavaSricpt to create a game that will be played in the browser console. The requirements for the project were provided by The Odin Project at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors.
